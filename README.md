# Kreg

## Product

This is a fun personal project I worked on in 2021 and made public in 2023.

Booking a tennis court in San Francisco is very difficult! I built Kreg (named after my beloved tennis instructor) to track all public tennis courts in San Francisco, and notify subscribers when a court was available relative to their desired playing time windows. It was used by many of my colleagues and friends to book courts while I lived in San Francisco. 

## Technology

As a personal project, the code is not production-grade, but it was a great way to get more reps with some cool technology including: 
- GCP including Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Functions, and Firestore
- Typescript with automated type coverage reporting
- Puppeteer and Cheeerio for web scraping
- Twilio
